    Unfortunately barlady Maarit does not understand English very well,<br> 
  so you should now learn some Finnish to get proper service!<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  To ask Maarit a drink, just simply say the name of the drink. Maarit<br> 
  understands most normal drinks like beer, coffee, whiskey in English.<br> 
  Do not worry if Maarit asks your ID ("Paperit, kiitos" or "Hohhoijaa").. <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  You can also ask Maarit to invite your friend to mobilesdisco! <br>
  If you want to invite your mobiles-friend to disco, say Maarit:<br>
  "kutsu alias discoon" (replace "alias" with the name of <br>
  your friend). If you would like to invite a new user to disco, <br>
  simply say "kutsu email@address discoon". Maarit will then <br>
  send your friend email.<br>
    &nbsp;<br>
    Maarit also remembers when people have been to disco previously. <br>
  Ask her "koska username viimeksi" and Maarit will respond with the visit time.<br>
  If you are interested about who have asked about you, say <br>
  "kuka on kysynyt mua". She will give you a list of the people <br>
  who have asked you..<br>
    &nbsp;<br>
    If you have hard time with our lovely Maarit, you can always ask <br>
  some Finnish mobile to help you..<br>
    &nbsp;<br>
    Yours, mobiles.<br>
